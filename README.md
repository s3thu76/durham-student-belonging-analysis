# Belonging or Burnout? Social Integration Among Graduate Students in Durham

This project explores how graduate students in Durham experience social integration and belonging, and which factors are most strongly associated with feeling connected to the community.

The analysis focuses on survey-based measures of belonging, social interaction frequency, and living context, and demonstrates a complete data science workflow: survey design, index construction, visualization, and interpretation.

## Research Question

How do time in Durham, living situation, and frequency of in-person social interactions relate to students’ sense of belonging?

---

## Methods

- Survey design with Likert-scale items
- Construction of a composite **Belonging Index**
- Exploratory data analysis
- Group comparisons
- Correlation analysis
- Data visualization (matplotlib)

---

## Key Findings

- Belonging is moderate on average, clustering around the midpoint of the scale
- Students new to Durham report lower belonging than those who have lived in the city longer
- Living with roommates or a partner is associated with higher belonging than living alone
- Frequency of in-person social interactions shows the strongest relationship with belonging
- Workload flexibility shows little association in this dataset

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with full analysis
- `outputs/`: Figures and summary tables used in the analysis

---

## Social Good Implications

Findings suggest that early-stage support for newcomers and programs that increase low-friction, recurring in-person interactions may meaningfully improve students’ sense of belonging.
